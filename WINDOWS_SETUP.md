Setting up your Windows computer so you can contribute
======================================================

Thorough instructions are coming soon. In the meantime, try [using Vagrant](VAGRANT_SETUP.md), or start your own quest:

You need rvm, or another way of installing Ruby 1.9.3 and creating an isolated $GEM_HOME.
You need git, so you can push/pull changes.
You need PostgreSQL.

See `UBUNTU_SETUP.md` and `OSX_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions that you may be able to adapt to Windows.
