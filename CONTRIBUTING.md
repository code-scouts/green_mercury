Contributing
============

Code Scouts welcomes contributions to the code base for this site!

If you want to help work on a known issue/feature, see our [issue tracker](https://trello.com/b/pHnfhYyh/green-mercury-new-codescouts-website).

If you have another idea that you'd like to contribute, great! Please do [create an issue](https://github.com/code-scouts/green_mercury/issues/) or [send an email to technical lead Andrew Lorente](mailto:andrew.lorente@gmail.com) first, so we can know what your idea is and make sure it fits with our vision of a great Code Scouts resource.

In general, patches should be:
* tested
* commented, where appropriate
* Roughly compliant with [the unofficial Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide)

We look forward to your pull requests!


How the heck do I get all the requirements to contribute?
=========================================================

Slowly, unfortunately, and it depends on whether you're running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
The website uses a version of both Ruby and Rails that is not installed by default on most of these platforms.

See [OSX_SETUP.md](OSX_SETUP.md) for instructions on getting set up on Mac OS X.

See [UBUNTU_SETUP.md](UBUNTU_SETUP.md) for instructions on getting set up on Ubuntu.

See [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](WINDOWS_SETUP.md) for instructions on getting set up on Windows.

Instructions for getting set up on Windows are coming soon!

I still have questions about contributing.
==========================================

Well that's great; this is a Code Scouts project and we welcome questions! Try asking in the #codescouts channel [on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/). If nobody seems to be around or you're not able to access IRC, you can also send an email to [technical lead Andrew Lorente](mailto:andrew.lorente@gmail.com).
